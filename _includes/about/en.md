> About my private info～


Hi，there，I‘m Levi.

I am an amateur who loves to collect. I like to stay at home with nothing to do, spend my time leisurely or find interesting items to work on.

##### Hobbies

- Surf the web, like to randomly scrape technical articles based on keywords and toss things I don't understand. Occasionally write some small scripts for my own use.
- Currently studying writing and js reverse programming on my own.
- Like to teach some knowledge to somebody.

##### Devices info
The following digital devices I'm currently using：

- iPad 2021
- vivo iqoo7
- Macbook pro2018(Dual system and have tried installing 'Hackintosh Apple'[Opencore] on a desktop computer)
- vivo y71(Currently learning on my own to try to unlock BL and brush in modules and downgrade packs)
- honor 9 lite(swiped into the native-like system, which is smoother to use than Emui)
